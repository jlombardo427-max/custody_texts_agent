Do you even put any thought into your words before you let them fall out of your mouth like shit into a toilet? Nothing falls on you. You 'help' with kids during my vacation yet can't bring Cameron to school at all. Carter is one thing but Cameron wasn't sick. You just didn't feel like taking only one kid. Don't throw in my face how you helped me for my vacation when I told you would do it but you insisted on wanting to be responsible for the week when I knew from the dick that the week was going to end up a flop bc you just aren't capable of being responsible enough or giving enough of a shit about their education to successfully handle taking care of them for a week straight. I literally called your every move before the week even started and then just sat back and sarcastically laughed when you literally did everything I said you'd do(or not do) literally in the exact same order as they ended up happening. But you're not simply only helpful and kind to me Kirby. My life is significantly more difficult in every way bc of my incessant responsibilities that normal people who actually have the other parent to 'co-parent' with don't have to go thru. I do 100% of the driving. That means Cameron TO ABD FROM school Monday-Friday. Plus it has been dumped on me ENTIRELY the responsibility of making sure he gets TO AND FROM drama practice 4 nights a week up until I left for vacation. I am responsible for making sure I am the responsible parent who actually wakes up every. Single. Day Monday-Friday to wake our children up and get them dressed and out the for to get to school in time or Carter to the bus in time. On Tuesdays Carter also had chorus and I have to make sure I DRIVE him to school by 8am. Then on mondays and thursdays I am responsible for picking Carter up at 515 from drama practice. On tuesdays and thursdays I'm responsible for dropping off and picking up Carter for soccer practice. Thursdays I pick up from drama and drive him directly to the field. Oh don't forget about band practice for whatever he just had. Pick him up at 4 drop off at pilla then pick up at 5 then drop off again at 6 at the high school then pick up at 8. Then every Friday night and Monday mornings I'm dropping them off or picking them up from your house IN ORDER TO HELP YOU. And you have the audacity to act like you help me with a god damn thing.,False,,False,2355
