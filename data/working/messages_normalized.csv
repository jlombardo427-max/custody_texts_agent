My life is significantly more difficult in every way bc of my incessant responsibilities that normal people who actually have the other parent to 'co-parent' with don't have to go thru.

On tuesdays and thursdays I'm responsible for dropping off and picking up Carter for soccer practice. Thursdays I pick up from drama and drive him directly to the field. Oh don't forget about band practice for whatever he just had. Pick him up at 4 drop off at pilla then pick up at 5 then drop off again at 6 at the high school then pick up at 8.

By then who knows where we'll be like if I'll be tired or calm or whatever or fired up and pissed off because then I can just start pulling out all the stuff I've kept in for all these years and I'm just saying it is definitely not in your best interest at all and certainly is not in mine as far as it being healthy for me. for us to spend any time in family Court more than just changing or taking away something important is the absolute last thing that I want only parts of but I've begged for you to make calls and go there until somebody helps us so you can tell someone I've been going through emergency medical stuff and unable to go to or get on Virtual Court for months and months and months but meanwhile you yourself is trying to end the child support and I'm owing more and more every week when I'm too sick there's got to be a different way we can approve this, that's what I needed you to do that's what I needed you to be doing",False,,False,4896

Unless I had up and decided I no longer wanted to be a mother and I no longer wanted to do everything in my power to get to my own place in Vineland as fast as I possibly could and have the ability to have them just as much as you if not more as fast as I possibly could, that their was no reason for child support anymore. At that time you were probably just happy you were getting all that money but I thought you were on the same page as me thinking that child support especially right now in our current situations is no longer even aligned fairly in the least, in fact it would absolutely be flipped the other direction and because of that I'd have the boys 50% of the time anyway. I can guarantee you that would be the case but that's not my point and it doesn't matter.

You were desperate then and I couldn't get anywhere near where they were going to school in order to help so it was just such a fucked situation but now I'm 2 miles away from you I'm a mile away from their school the only reason I don't have them half of the time is because you had taken the one bus that is allotted for our kids and had it assigned to your house knowing that you had a vehicle and that you were not in the hospital when school started and that you could easily get them there but probably never even considering how the hell I would, and if you did consider it then you knew I couldn't.",False,,False,5829

I have given way way more than I should have had to have given to get to the place I am now which is literally nowhere better than where I was a year ago until fucking child support ends.

But no yeah no none of that you really get upset about that even though you have helped a few times, it's not a favor to me it's you driving a few miles to get your kids to school. like I'm just not prepared to let decades and decades of my dad's life and commitment even when he couldn't fucking see straight literally, even when he was dying, I'm not going to allow all of that work that he put into building this average amount of an inheritance that then got split into four and a fourth of it was given to me and then a bunch of it was handed to you, when I guarantee what he was hoping would happen is that I would use a little to I don't know get myself on track if I wasn't and instead mainly multiply that quarter of his inheritance for it to be much larger for my kids when they became adults, yeah I'm not prepared to watch any more of that just walk away into literally the home of their father. Because every penny of it that leaves the account it's in right now is leaving our kids. It is plain and simple. I hate even buying things that we need which is why I'm still wearing hospital clothes until I can physically just get my shit that doesn't fit for my mom's instead of buying myself underwear or clothes for myself because I know that once it is no longer in the IRA it's sitting him right now it's no longer working. It's fucking dead and spent on something that will be gone just as quickly as it came. You don't have to answer this cuz it's more like a rhetorical question, either way it's more kind of like the overall idea of this that matters to me but aren't you like in the middle of eviction court and stuff with your landlord, like it's just a matter of time until you're leaving there?

I kept telling her it made no sense there was a lien on my account because I just had paid the money a couple days prior so I was telling her I could give her a receipt or whatever she needed like my bank statements whatever and this was her response and then my response back etc. The reason they're not taking the money like they did last time is because they already see that payment processing they know that it's been paid. That's what the woman from child support told me right off the bat when I called. But you've put me through so fucking much that I just short out in depression from all of it so very shortly after this text exchange with my advisors assistant I just shorted out. I don't know a single other person that could go through the things I'm put through and just keep it moving. Every single part of being a mother you try to take away from me and make impossible And then the parental alienation going on in your house is absolutely insane. That my own son is telling me to show him the receipts for child support when he was just screaming in my face weeks ago that you would never take child support for me and that I don't get charged child support??? It's sick shit man. And it's either because of how you're talking to him or how you're talking to Amanda in the house around him. I shouldn't have to lay that out the fact is it's coming from you.

But listen,   I don’t have great news.     I actually am quite upset with it myself, but Dyfs contacted me because the spoke with the kids.   Apparently between what reports were given by police that night as well as whatever occurred between the children and them and the children and Dyfs,  I’ve been leveraged with no choice but to file for temporary custody.     THIS HAD TO BE DONE OR THEY WERE GOING TO A FOSTER HOME.      I was basically told that they need to work with you further and until then I either needed to ask for temp custody,  or,  in the alternative,  they were removing the children from both of our homes if they felt I couldn’t keep them safe here.

But they are trying to apparently reach you and you’re not answering…. They’re trying to help and get this put behind us and help us both have the kids again.

I have no clue what was said or what was seen,  but whatever it was was serious enough for the concerns.   Maybe it’s nothing .  I don’t know.

They said that while Carter was vandalizing things you were asleep.
